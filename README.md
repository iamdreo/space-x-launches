# About project

The project was created with the aim of being in a small application where users could search and compare space x launches

# Thoughts behind project design

I wanted the project to be as simple as possible for the user and kind of minimize the amount of clicks the user will have to make so the thought was once a user selects any two launches, it automatically compares them and once the user closes it, it resets the state of the selected launches 

# Limitations

While trying to run the space x api, it gaves errors when fetching the entire payload on apollo client so because of the restriction of time decided to use graphwl-client since its a small project and we dont need to much capablities

Given more time, i would have liked to come up with a prettier ui
improve code quality
write unit tests
write better end to end tests
and more

it was a really interesting project
